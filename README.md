# CS5100 Final Project

## Introduction  

Our goal of this project is to predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases in various locations across the world, 
as well as the number of resulting fatalities, for future dates.  

## Dataset. 

We use the COVID19 time series data from John Hopkins CSSE. This repository is updated once a day.   

At the time we started our project, the data is updated to 17/10/22. Therefore, the visualization and model training are based on the data before that date.  

This link contains the datasets we use.

Because the recovered dataset is not updated after 5/8/21, we use the confirmed and deaths dataset before that date as well for data visualization.
